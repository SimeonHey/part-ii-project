## 100-word Draft

Bigger software projects often employ multiple data storage systems in order to take advantage of different storage/retrieval patterns. Each of them could provide some consistency model (i. e strong consistency), but often no guarantees are given for when they are combined together. The "Online Event Processing" paradigm proposed by Martin Kleppmann et. al provides an eventually consistent solution to this problem. My project will explore ways to provide stronger consistency guarantees (e. g snapshot isolation) for heterogeneous storage systems.
